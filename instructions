The user should be able to view a web page which shows the most recent
posts in date order. They should be able to click the delete button to delete an
individual post from this view. One a post is deleted it should not reappear,
even if the HN API returns it. Also, keep an eye on how the date is presented
on each row in the wireframes.

You must use the following technologies to build the app:
- Server component: Node.js + Express / KOA + MongoDB
- Client component: Angular + Angular Material (https://material.angular.io/)
- TypeScript
- Grunt / Gulp
Other that that you are free to use any suitable npm or other libraries.

Send us your completed code as a public Github repo url emailed to
veronika@reigndesign.com. Include a README which explains anything we
need to do to run the demo app, for example: setting up a database, forcing a
data refresh to populate the DB for the first time, etc.
If you have any questions about the task, please let us know.

Once again, thank you for your time and we are looking forward to see the
results!

Cheers,
- Veronika
